        The C# language provides a handy way to declare, subscribe to and fire events.
        Technically, an event is a "slot" where callback functions (event handlers) can
        be attached to - a process referred to as subscribing to an event. Here is
        a handy package that encapsulates the core to event subscription and event
        firing and feels like a "natural" part of the language.
        
        .. code-block:: pycon
         
            >>> def something_changed(reason): 
            ...     print "something changed because %s" % reason 
            ...
        
            >>> from events import Events
            >>> events = Events()
            >>> events.on_change += something_changed
        
        Multiple callback functions can subscribe to the same event. When the event is
        fired, all attached event handlers are invoked in sequence. To fire the event,
        perform a call on the slot: 
        
        .. code-block:: pycon
        
            >>> events.on_change('it had to happen')
            'something changed because it had to happen'
        
        By default, Events does not check if an event can be subscribed to and fired. 
        You can predefine events by subclassing Events and listing them. Attempts to
        subscribe to or fire an undefined event will raise an EventsException.
        
        .. code-block:: pycon
         
            >>> class MyEvents(Events):
            ...     __events__ = ('on_this', 'on_that', )
        
            >>> events = MyEvents()
        
            # this will raise an EventsException as `on_change` is unknown to MyEvents:
            >>> events.on_change += something_changed
        
        You can also predefine events for a single Events instance by passing an iterator to the constructor.
        
        .. code-block:: pycon
        
            >>> events = Events(('on_this', 'on_that'))
        
            # this will raise an EventsException as `on_change` is unknown to events:
            >>> events.on_change += something_changed
